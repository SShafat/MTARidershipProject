# MTA's Ridership 


Data Science project done as research for CMP 464, during Spring 2017. All of the data has been collected from the MTA.info website. The data is used to present and directly compare the number of riders in each platform (i.e. Bus/Subway). The analysis depicts the difference between subway riders and bus riders but also how the individual ridership has increased and decreased in the recent past years.
