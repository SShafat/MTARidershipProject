# MTARidershipProject


This project is for my Data Science class, CMP 464, Spring 2017.All of my data has been collected from the MTA.info website presented to directly compare the number of riders in each platform. The analysis depicts the difference between subway riders and bus riders but also how the individual ridership has increased and decreased in the recent past years.
